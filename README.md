# 🃏 Set! Web Game

A fully interactive, browser-based version of the classic **Set!** card game built with **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.  
This project dynamically generates randomized cards, tracks sets found, manages a countdown timer, and provides instant feedback — all within a clean, responsive UI.

---

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

In **Set!**, each card has four attributes:

| Attribute | Options |
|------------|----------|
| **Style** | solid, outline, striped |
| **Color** | red, green, purple |
| **Shape** | diamond, oval, squiggle |
| **Count** | 1, 2, 3 |

A **Set** consists of **three cards** where, for *each attribute*, the values are either **all the same** or **all different**.

### 🧩 Example
✅ These three cards form a set because:
- All have the same **count**
- Each has a different **style**, **color**, and **shape**

❌ The following three cards are *not* a set because two share the same color and one doesn’t.

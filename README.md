# Set-Game
Set! A fully interactive web-based version of the classic Set card game built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The project dynamically generates cards with randomized attributes, manages user interactions and validates Sets. Implemented modular JavaScript design, DOM manipulation, and game state management for my 4th grade students at church.
